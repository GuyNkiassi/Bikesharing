# NYC Ctibikesharing Analysis

    Module 14 - Citi Bike analysis

# Overview

Purpose- This analysis is to propare visualizations that give potential investors a look into highly-successful NYC Bike-sharing program so they can determine if this is a good business investment or not. Among others, the visaulization will show 1) The length of time that bikes are checked out for all rides and genders, 2) The number of Bike trips for all rides and genders for each hour of each week, and 3) the number of bike trips for each types of users and gender for each day of the week.


# Resources

   201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, 201908-updated_tripdata.csv

   Software: Tableau, Python 3.7.6, Juupyter NB, Pandas Library

# Results

   The results of our analysis have been incorporated into a story on Tableau Public

   Comparing visualizations for the 'Top Starting Locations' and 'Top Ending Locations', we can see that the most active starting locations are also among the most active ending locations. This is important, because we need to know whether there might be an excess or shortage of bikes at particularly stations over time.

    - Looking at visualizations for 'Checkout Times for Users' and 'Checkout Times by Gender', we see that most rides are for 20 minutes or less, and that the vast majority of rides are less than one hour. We also see that this pattern is the same regardless of gender.

  
    - The heatmap of 'Trips by Weekday per Hour' shows a clear pattern of bicycle useage 1) during the morning weekday commute (7-9 a.m.), 2) during the evening weekday commute (4-7 p.m.) except on Wednesday evenings, and 3) all day long on weekends.

    - The 'Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)' heatmap shows that the useage pattern is true regardless of gender, although the total numbers for males is considerably higher.

    - The 'User Trips by Gender by Weekday' heatmap demonstrates the following points: subscribers are mostly male and account for most of the weekday activity, customers' gender are often unknown, and useage on the weekend is more evenly split between subscribers and customers.

# SUMMARY

 Giving the results of the visualization, we have seen patterns of usage of time and gender. Utilization rtaes can be predicated based on time od day and location. Weekly usage is most of the time in the morning and afternoon commute. Weekend usage is mainly around the morning and afternnon. we also need more analysis to compare weekend trip duration to weekday trp. we miight also find out if we can add more analysis to identify the unuse area of the visualization.
